Moreover, this notebook uses various models to predict the popularity a movie or show receives on TMDB. \n\nNote that this notebook was created primarily to analyze the trends in a dataset, whatever information it may regard; essentially, this was intended to be a practice exercise. However, I found some appealing and unexpected patterns in this movie/show dataset that prompted me to release my work on Kaggle.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Executive Summary \nThis summary briefly captures the gist of the information discussed. It is recommended that you look through the whole notebook, or even conduct some research of your own, to discover all the patterns/trends that lay hidden. \n\nThe analysis of this dataset verified some expected trends that one might expect. The thriller genre was the most popular, and shows from Korea, Japan, and China were highly successful in terms of popularity.\nWhile confirming many patent trends, the analysis also sheds light on some unexpected nuances. For example, there was no connection between the score a movie received on TMDB and the popularity it received on the TMDB. The rating on IMDb and the popularity on TMDB exhibited a similar relationship as well. Countries such as Colombia and Poland were chosen quite frequently as locations for production and had more popularity as well. Additionally, shows for younger audiences, rated either `TV-G`, `TV-Y`, or `TV-Y7`, received high popularity ratings on TMDB. These shows scored higher (on average) on IMDb *and* TMDB.\n\nWhile subtle, these trends may have some implications for the average movie/show director, especially one interested in optimizing popularity. To achieve such an ambitious goal, a director may want to create a thriller show for younger audiences. As the show gains popularity, the director should continue to add more seasons to it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploration Objectives \n\n","metadata":{"id":"9zVeetUY-Bca"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This section is primarily concerned with identifying trends between two or three features from the data set.

Moreover, it is hard to deduce a proper metric for scoring shows solely based on genre as other factors, such as plot, length, and acting, prove to be crucial to an average viewer's method for rating a particular show. Nonetheless, the distribution of average scores for genres is uniform and indicates that genre is not necessarily a primary metric for deducing the rating a show receives. This finding is expected as the people who rate shows of a particular genre compare that show to other shows of that same genre. This regularizes the methodology used by IMDb or TMDB users to judge genres, thus resulting in an overall negligible difference in rating.\n\nHowever, there was a considerable difference in the popularity. Most people, it seems, enjoyed watching shows that belonged to the thiller, family, or science fiction genres.
